# Fitness-Website-
This was a project I took on whilst in the second year of my FDSC. A fitness instructor wanted his website re-worked and I started work through the client's list of requirements.

Though I was working alone, I based my project management on the agile principles of SCRUM. 

The project fell through, but this was as far as I got.
